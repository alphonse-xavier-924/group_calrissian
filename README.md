### 5Vs Analysis
- **Volume:** High - 10 million records and 1.27 GB of data make it a substantial dataset.
- **Velocity:** Likely low - Web server logs are generally not high-velocity unless from a very busy site.
- **Variety:** Moderate - The dataset includes fields such as IP addresses, timestamps, HTTP methods, URLs, and status codes, providing some field diversity within a structured format.
- **Veracity:** Potentially high - Assuming standard web server logs, the data should be fairly reliable. However, it's essential to check for any biases or inconsistencies.
- **Value:** Good potential - The dataset can be valuable for analyzing user behavior, identifying trends, and detecting anomalies. It enables exploration of user access patterns, website traffic analysis, and identification of potential security threats.
